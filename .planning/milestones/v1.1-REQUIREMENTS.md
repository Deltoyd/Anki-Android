# Requirements Archive: v1.1 Puzzle Shape & Transparency Fix

**Archived:** 2026-02-13
**Status:** All requirements complete

## v1.1 Requirements

### Shape Fix

- [x] **SHPE-01**: Unlocked pieces clip the painting to the same jigsaw shape as their locked PNG counterpart
- [x] **SHPE-02**: Unlocked piece borders match locked piece outlines (no visible shape mismatch)

### Transparency

- [x] **TRANS-01**: Locked pieces render at 80% opacity so the painting is visible underneath
- [x] **TRANS-02**: Unlocked pieces remain at full opacity (existing behavior unchanged)

## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase | Status | Outcome |
|-------------|-------|--------|---------|
| SHPE-01 | Phase 2 | Complete | PNG alpha mask compositing via PorterDuff DST_IN |
| SHPE-02 | Phase 2 | Complete | User verified on Pixel 7a — no visible mismatch |
| TRANS-01 | Phase 3 | Complete | saveLayer + DST_IN + alpha 204 overlay |
| TRANS-02 | Phase 3 | Complete | Unlocked branch untouched — full opacity preserved |
